Under UNIX, compile TimeChart and AstronomicalTime to produce
AstronomicalChart, an executable, with the command

g++ -lm TimeChart.cpp AstronomicalTime.cpp -o AstronomicalChart

Run astronomical chart by typing ./AstronomicalChart

AstronomicalChart allows the input of three possible astronomical
variable objects, V471 Tauri, FF Aquarii, and Algol, all eclipsing
binary star systems. It also takes the input of the observer's
lattitutde in hours and lattitude in degrees. Using this input and
ephemerii taken from literature quoted in the text of the code,
AstronomicalChart produces a table of local times and dates, universal
times and dates, Heliocentric Julain Dates, Siderial times, precessed
right acensions and declinations, the corresponding azimuth and
altitude, approximate air mass, hour angle, and phase of the variable
object. These hourly updates are displayed for the nighttime hours of
each day for the time interval selected by the user, assuming night is
from 7pm to 5am. This chart is output to the text file timeChart.txt.
